#Growing with Test

#Tools chapter

I will follow the chapter but I will try to use the current version of the software.

The book uses Jmock2. Looks like a litle bit outdate.

I do not knwow if use mockit or mockito. [Baeldung choose Mockit](https://www.baeldung.com/mockito-vs-easymock-vs-jmockit), so I will do the same.
