# Retail fair

This is an aplication to learn fast api.

## Business case

This is a sample aplication to manage retail fairs. I will have persons. One person can generate multiple retail fairs.

The event will be always in the street and the persons that sell things in the fair will be retailers. Each retailer will have a location in the street. A location is composed by multiple adjacent position. Each position is corresponding to one meter in the street and will have the coordinates for that possition. 

Each organizar could see all the events he orginize. For each event he can see all of the retailes with its positions. Only the orgnizar could add or modify retailers on the event. 

Each person could see all the events is participating. On a participating event the person could see his position but not the rest of the retailers

## Fairs Background

This project will have just the background part of the application. If I do find force I may add the fairs web part.
